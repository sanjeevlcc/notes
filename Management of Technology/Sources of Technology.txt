============================
Technology can be acquired in different ways. 
It can be internally developed by R&D or discovery, it can be 
obtained by buying or otherwise acquiring an innovation resulting
from R&D or discovery, during various stages of the innovation 
process, or after the technology has
been largely perfected and approaches maturity.

Methods of technology acquisition are quite diverse and include 
purchase, transfer, and licensing, which in turn may involve 
acquisition of knowledge, process, product, or right to use of the technology.

Technology acquisition is complex because it combines 
efforts of protection of the rights of the owner and those of the
acquirer. 



Research and Development (R&D) Labs:
============================
Companies like IBM, Google, Microsoft, etc., have dedicated R&D labs.
Government-funded research institutions like NASA, DARPA, etc.



Universities and Academic Institutions:
============================
Often involved in cutting-edge research and development.
Examples include MIT, Stanford, Cambridge, etc.


Startups and Small Enterprises:
============================
Often innovate in niche areas.
Agile and quick to adapt.


Open Source Community:
============================
Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, etc., foster collaboration.
Projects like Linux, Apache, TensorFlow, etc., are developed collaboratively.
