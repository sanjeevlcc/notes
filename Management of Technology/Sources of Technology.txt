============================
Technology can be acquired in different ways. 
It can be internally developed by R&D or discovery, it can be 
obtained by buying or otherwise acquiring an innovation resulting
from R&D or discovery, during various stages of the innovation 
process, or after the technology has
been largely perfected and approaches maturity.

Methods of technology acquisition are quite diverse and include 
purchase, transfer, and licensing, which in turn may involve 
acquisition of knowledge, process, product, or right to use of the technology.

Technology acquisition is complex because it combines 
efforts of protection of the rights of the owner and those of the
acquirer.

Changing Context of Technological Environment
===============================================

The technological environment is dynamic and constantly 
evolving due to several factors.

Social and technological environments impact business decision-making. 
These are the 'S' and 'T' elements of the PESTLE analysis . The social environment includes factors like lifestyle and consumer trends. 

The technological environment includes factors like artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

These external factors all have the ability to influence business strategy and objectives. Let's take a look


PESTLE Analysis is a strategic framework used to understand the external macro-environmental factors that might impact an organization. The acronym stands for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental factors. This analysis helps businesses in strategic planning and decision-making by providing insights into the broader context in which they operate.





Social Environment (S)
----------------------
The social environment includes the demographic and 
cultural aspects of the external environment. 
These factors affect customer needs and the size of potential markets.

Demographics:
----------------------
Age distribution, population growth rate, and population health.
Example: An aging population may increase 
demand for healthcare services and retirement homes​ (Codegiant)​​ (CloudThat)​.

Lifestyle Changes:
----------------------
Changes in lifestyle trends can impact consumer behavior and preferences.
Example: The rise of health-conscious consumers has
increased demand for organic food products and fitness-related services​ (Codegiant)​.


Education Levels:
----------------------
Higher education levels can lead to a more skilled 
workforce and greater demand for high-tech products.

Example: Regions with higher education levels may have a higher demand for technology-driven products and services​ (CTO.ai)​.
Cultural Norms and Values:

Cultural shifts and societal values can influence business practices and consumer expectations.
Example: Increasing focus on sustainability has driven companies to adopt eco-friendly practices and products​ (CloudThat)​.
Technological Environment (T)
The technological environment encompasses the state of technological advancement and innovation. It includes factors that influence how technology impacts the industry and market.

Technological Advancements:

The rate of technological change and innovation.
Example: Rapid advancements in AI and machine learning are transforming industries such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing​ (Codegiant)​.
Research and Development (R&D) Activity:

Levels of investment in R&D can drive innovation and competitive advantage.
Example: Companies investing heavily in R&D may develop cutting-edge products that differentiate them from competitors​ (CTO.ai)​.
Automation and Digital Transformation:

The adoption of automation and digital technologies to improve efficiency.
Example: The integration of automation in manufacturing processes can significantly reduce production costs and increase output​ (Codegiant)​.
Technology Infrastructure:

The availability and quality of technological infrastructure such as internet connectivity and telecommunications.
Example: Regions with advanced technology infrastructure can support the growth of digital businesses and e-commerce​ (CloudThat)​.
Innovation Ecosystem:

The presence of a supportive ecosystem for startups and technological innovation.
