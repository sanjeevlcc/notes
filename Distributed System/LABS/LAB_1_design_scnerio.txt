Operating System (OS)
=================================================

An Operating System (OS) is 
        system software that manages computer 
        hardware, software resources, and 
        provides common services for computer programs. 

The operating system acts as an intermediary 
        between users and the computer hardware. 

Its primary functions include managing the computer's 
        memory, 
        processes, 
        hardware, and 
        software resources, 
        as well as providing a user interface and 
        ensuring security and access controls.

=================================================
types of operating systems
=================================================

Single-User Operating Systems:
--------------------------------
        Designed to support one user at a time.
        MS-DOS and early versions of Apple Macintosh operating systems.



Multi-User Operating Systems:
--------------------------------
        Designed to support multiple users simultaneously.
        
        Examples include
        Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) and
        modern versions of Microsoft Windows.



Multi-Tasking Operating Systems:
--------------------------------
        Allow multiple tasks or processes to run concurrently.
        
        Examples include 
        Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and 
        modern versions of Microsoft Windows.


Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):
--------------------------------
        Designed to handle tasks with specific timing constraints.

        Used in 
        embedded systems, 
        industrial automation, and 
        other time-critical applications.
        
        Examples include FreeRTOS, VxWorks, and QNX.


Batch Processing Operating Systems:
--------------------------------
        Designed to execute tasks in batches without user interaction.
        
        Commonly used in mainframe computers for 
        processing large volumes of data.
        
        Examples include IBM z/OS (formerly known as OS/390 and MVS).


Distributed Operating Systems:
--------------------------------
        Run on multiple interconnected computers 
        and coordinate their activities.
        
        Provide a unified interface to users and 
        applications across the network.
        
        Examples include Google's Chrome OS and 
        various cluster computing systems.


Network Operating Systems (NOS):
--------------------------------
        Designed to facilitate network communication 
        and resource sharing among multiple computers.
        
        Provide file and printer sharing, 
        user authentication, and other 
        network-related services.
        
        Examples include Novell NetWare, Windows Server, 
        and Linux-based server distributions.




Embedded Operating Systems:
--------------------------------
        Optimized for use in embedded systems with 
        limited resources (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, automotive systems).
        
        Compact, efficient, and often 
        tailored to specific hardware platforms.
        
        Examples include Android, iOS, and
        real-time operating systems like FreeRTOS.
